                    <h1 className="gradient">My Coding Journey <i className='bx bx-code-block' ></i></h1>
                    <p>Every coder has their own unique journey, and mine has been shaped by passion, challenges, and growth. From my early exposure to programming to solving complex algorithms and building real-world applications, my coding journey has been both rewarding and transformative. Here's a snapshot of how I've evolved:
                    <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Foundations in Problem Solving: </b> I started with a strong focus on core Data Structures and Algorithms, which gave me the skills to solve complex problems.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Consistent Growth Through Challenges: </b> With 300+ consecutive days on LeetCode and 150+ consecutive days on GFG, I've developed a habit of tackling new challenges daily, improving both my speed and understanding of algorithms.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Github Repository:  </b>  I believe in sharing my learning, so I've been uploading my solutions on GitHub to document my progress and make it available to others.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Building Projects: </b> My journey wasn't limited to solving problems; I've translated my learning into projects like ChitChat Live and a virtual mouse program in Python.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Continuous Learning: </b> Whether it's completing Coursera courses on machine learning or diving into new technologies, I am always learning. I believe in evolving constantly and embracing new programming paradigms and tools.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        Through each challenge, I not only solve problems but also learn how to think critically, break down complex tasks, and persist in the face of difficulty. My journey is far from over, and I look forward to solving even more problems, learning new skills, and making meaningful contributions to the tech community.
